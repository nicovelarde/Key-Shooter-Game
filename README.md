EXTRA CREDIT POINTS
I did both of the extra credit work.
1. Better visual for removing correct word. When a correct word is found, it is marked as green and a delay of 1 second is applied before removing it, this helps to differentiate it from other words, its implementation is in Words.java from line 162 - 174
2. More paths for the words to take. I made it such that a random point is generated and based on it, an endpoint is also generated which makes it produce many different paths for different words. Its implementation is in Words.java from line 95 - 119
